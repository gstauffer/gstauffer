# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Graham

I work as the Data Analytics Coordinator for Eastern Mennonite University. I enjoy learning about all things technology, software or hardware. I currently work primarily with SQL and Python but also am picking up some R. 

On my own time, I also enjoy working on my homelab to try out new and interesting tools.
